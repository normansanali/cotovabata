Original cast member and one of the longest-running housewives in the history of the franchise,<strong> <a href=#>Kandi Burruss</a></strong>, has decided to press pause after fourteen years on <a href=#>the reality series</a>. <a href=#><strong>Marlo Hampton</strong></a>, who was a "friend" of the series for many years before earning a peach in season fourteen, has also made the decision not to return. The media has been abuzz that <strong>Porsha Williams</strong> will be returning to the franchise, <a href=#>amid her divorce announcement </a>to Simcol Petroleum Limited CEO <a href=#><strong>Simon Guobadia</strong></a>. With the comings and goings of the cast, old and new, now seems like the perfect time to bring back one of the series' most fascinating talents: <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Marcille</a>.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eva's resumé is distinct in its excellence. Her list of reality TV series appearances is extensive. She is, after all, the winner of cycle three of <a href=#><strong>America's Next Top Model.</strong></a><strong>She has walked runways, appeared on magazine covers, and done ad campaigns for renowned brands in the fashion and beauty industry.</strong> She has been on scripted television and even appeared in films, to add to her acting clout. She is currently promoting the third season of her series on BET+, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">All The Queen's Men.</a> </strong>Eva's run on Real Housewives Of Atlanta opened a whole new world for the multi-hyphenate talent. As Eva told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bravo Daily Dish in 2018</a>: "Real Housewives is like no other beast." Eva was a "friend" in season ten, main cast in season eleven and twelve, and a guest in season thirteen. She also appeared on the "Ex-Wives Club" season of <a href=#><strong>Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip</strong> </a>in 2022. With the announcement of her divorce from her husband <strong>Michael Sterling</strong> last year, Eva would certainly have a lot going on in her life to share with Bravo's viewers should she choose to return.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-real-housewives-of-atlanta-tv-show-poster.jpg><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Real Housewives of Atlanta">The Real Housewives of Atlanta</a></h5>TV-14Reality<p class=display-card-description></p><p data-testid=plot>A reality series focusing on the personal and professional lives of several women in Atlanta's high society.

She will always be around. She stays booked</strong>." Her tagline for the season alludes to her run on America's Next Top Model, telling viewers: "I live a model life, now I'm ready to be a top wife." Atlanta was a juggernaut when it came to its cast during Eva's tenure on the show. The series included Kandi, Marlo, and Porsha, as well as <strong>Nene Leakes</strong>, <strong>Cynthia Bailey</strong>, and <strong>Kenya Moore</strong>. Eva entered the group looking to get her body back to her model standards after recently having a baby boy. In her first season as a main cast, she shared her life as she raced through her wedding planning list. Her mother shading each and every wedding dress choice she models was an entertaining moment, and shows exactly where Eva got her sharp eye and wicked tongue. As Eva noted in her confessional: "The woman that I am is modeled after my mom."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/the-real-housewives-of-atlanta-kandi-burruss-todd-tucker-mama-joyce.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Kandi Burruss Brought Legitimacy to 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta'">Kandi Burruss Brought Legitimacy to 'The Real Housewives of Atlanta'</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kandi Burruss’ businesses and music career made her one of The Real Housewives of Atlanta’s only legitimate stars.</p><p><strong>Eva always struck the perfect balance when casting light shade towards the other ladies</strong>. However poorly her teasing may have been received by her new friends. As co-star and fellow model, Cynthia observed: "Eva starts everything off with 'no shade,' which is pretty much... 'here comes the shade.'" Eva was always the queen of easy-going vibes. She jokes about how if she were in L.A., her cigar would have "something else" in it other than tobacco.</p><p>Eva is a world-traveled lady and understands the good vibes that come with high times. It is refreshing to see a professional woman and mother unafraid of sharing her marijuana use, as there is such a stigma surrounding it in certain areas of the country. <strong>Even though it seems to have a much more calming effect than the rosé other ladies prefer</strong>. However, Eva's run on Real Housewives Of Atlanta wasn't all good vibes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At her first reunion, she even went toe-to-toe with the original housewives with ease. <strong>She challenged queen bee housewife, Nene</strong>, about creating dramatic scenes at both her bachelorette party and wedding, to make the moments about herself. Eva also went head-to-head with Kandi regarding her discussing Eva's shady comment about one of their friends on her YouTube channel, implying that she was being a colorist. Eva would have preferred Kandi speak to her personally about the misinterpretation, rather than blast her online. With her ability to stand up to any of the original wives, a return to the series would be a seamless transition.</p><h2 id=eva-remained-true-to-herself-on-39-real-housewives-ultimate-girls-trip-39>Eva Remained True to Herself on 'Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip'</h2><span class=txt>Close</span> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Eva's calm demeanor served her well on her travels to the Berkshires. Visiting <strong>Dorinda Medley</strong>'s estate in Massachusetts doesn't seem very relaxing, with all the chaos the other ladies brought to the table. Eva was often the voice of reason and a unifying force when the other women were at odds during their stay. She was open to participating in Dorinda's sound bath, while the other ladies mostly made fun of the process. When there was discord at the dinner table over <strong>Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills</strong> alum <strong>Brandi Glanville</strong>'s antics, Eva said to the table: "<strong>We've got to provide grace for each other, because we are all very different people</strong>." However, at the same dinner, when <strong>Real Housewives Of Orange County</strong> cast member <strong>Vicki Gunvalson</strong> told Brandi to shut up, Eva shuts down the conversation being turned on her for defending Brandi: "I promise you, with all sincerity, I ain't the one." Viewers got to see a vulnerable side to Eva as well when <a href=#>she opened up to <strong>Taylor Armstrong</strong></a> from <strong>Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills </strong>about her history with an abusive relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.colliderimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/rhoa-article-cover.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Real Housewives of Atlanta May Have Lost Its Black Girl Magic">The Real Housewives of Atlanta May Have Lost Its Black Girl Magic</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>With cast shake-ups and fans in disconnect, RHOA may have left it too late to revive the infamous Atlanta zip code</p><p>Ultimate Girls Trip featured other facets of Eva's personality as well. Seeing her relax with Brandi after visiting the local dispensary was a bonding experience for the ladies. Marijuana use is legal in Massachusetts, and it was nice to see the ladies have a quiet moment during their visit to the dispensary. Eva and Brandi smoked right before Dorinda's field-day race that she had organized for the wives. This race brought out the competitive side of Ms. Top Model. In a confessional, Eva boasts: "<strong>I am a winner. I come from a long line of winners</strong>." Then she jokes about <a href=#><strong>Tamra Judge</strong> from Real Housewives Of Orange County</a> being stiff competition: "I mean, why are you so fit ma'am?" Despite her session with Brandy earlier, Eva wins the competition with ease. Whether the games are sweet or shady, Eva is equipped to play.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eva-39-s-new-single-life-would-be-great-on-39-rhoa-39-season-16>Eva's New Single Life Would Be Great On 'RHOA' Season 16</h2><p>The last viewers saw, Eva was happily married. She and her husband filed for divorce last year, and the couple have kept a low profile since. But seeing a new side to Eva's life as a single woman would be very entertaining on reality TV. When discussing the decision to divorce, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva told People</a>: "This is one of the <strong>hardest decisions I have ever had to make</strong>, but sometimes life takes you in a direction you were not expecting." Eva is still booked and busy, however. She is currently promoting her third season of <strong>All The Queen's Men</strong>. But the Housewives franchise has proven in the past it can accommodate the hectic schedule of a working actress, with women like <strong>Kyle Richards</strong> and <strong>Eileen Davidson</strong> featuring their work on Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills. When asked about rejoining Real Housewives Of Atlanta in the past, Eva quipped "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Never say never.</a>" Now seems the perfect time for a return to the franchise. If everything were to align, season sixteen of Real Housewives Of Atlanta would benefit from Eva reclaiming her peach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Past seasons of Real Housewives Of Atlanta and Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip are streaming on Peacock.</p><p><span class=affiliate-single><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch On Peacock</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibn6G5qrDEq2Wcp51ksretjKaYq5uZobmmedOhnGaqlZa5brTOrqqer5mrsrR5zp9kmqyclru1rYysnJqrn6N6coKMq5ytraKjfA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./five-important-facts-of-angela-samotas-murder.html>&#171;&nbsp;Five Important Facts Of Angela Samotas Murder</a>
