His first upload was a video on 10 July 2017 where he is having fun with his friend. Later, he also shared a glimpse of his talent as a sportscaster. The video went viral in no time and soon received 100+ likes. This motivated him further to create and share more of such content. Alas, those videos didn’t go as well as his first video.</p><p>Bob later changed his strategy and started making parody videos for the games. The strategy&nbsp;helped him earn back viewers. Through his unique and innovative content and voice, Bob has so far earned huge followers of 2.4 million followers as of March 2020. Bob is an Instagram comedian whose viral play-by-play videos rack up millions of plays at present. Bob also shares drive-thru antics on his Instagram.</p><p>Furthermore, Bob got the chance to call a game for the Indoor Football League’s Salt Lake Screaming Eagles. Also, he was a part of the TV series “Billions”&nbsp;in the year 2019.&nbsp;After immersing in acting for four years, he returned home to Boston from Los Angeles.</p><h4><span>YouTube</span></h4><p>Bob created his self-titled YouTube channel on 25 March 2013 and so far has 421,401 views. The oldest video on this channel dates back to 11 July 2019 and its title is GET A CUSTOM BOB MENERY COMMENTARY VIDEO!!.<br>The video has 21,453 views so far.

Source: Youtube</p><h2><span id=Bob_Menery_8211_Net_Worth_2024>Bob Menery – Net Worth 2024</span></h2><p>Similarly, talking about his <strong>net worth</strong> is estimated at around $5 million. He mostly earns from Instagram in the 5-digit range with an engagement rate of 1.31%.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Bob Menery is most probably <strong>single</strong> at the moment. He hasn’t shared much information regarding this issue on his social media accounts. He also hasn’t shared yet about his past affairs. Further, he might be more focused on strengthening his career and professional life rather than sharing his personal affairs with the public.</p><p>However, in one of his parody videos last year, Bob used the word “girlfriend” for the model Katie Kearney, hinting that he has a crush on her. However, he and Katie both haven’t talked any more about this issue and hence their relationship with each other is not clear even at present.</p><h2><span id=Controversy>Controversy</span></h2><p>Bob Menery was involved in a controversy with PGA. Bob told&nbsp;The Blast&nbsp;that PGA content is some of the funnier stuff on his social media page. He was shocked on Monday when the golf organization sent him a direct message. It read, “We will issue a takedown on this video by this evening if we don’t hear back from you.”</p><p>Talking more precisely about the video in question, it had to do with pro golfer Matthew Wolff sinking a 26-foot eagle putt to win the 3M Open tournament that weekend in July 2019. Furthermore, although PGA may not appreciate his use of comedic vulgarity,&nbsp;Bob believes that the world is shifting and people want an outlet to laugh, which he is successful in providing them.</p><p>Moreover, Bob also pointed out that he does not monetize any of his videos from the PGA, and believes he played a big part in getting kids to be interested in the game of golf. He also jokes that through the views of the millions on his channel, he has helped kids put down Fortnite and cheer for PGA tour players.</p><p>Menery is a huge fan of golf and he gained fame after being discovered through his video where he showcased his amazing voice. Bob is also recognized by pro golfers like Tiger Woods. Also, fans yell Bob’s catchphrase of “Ripper Magoos!” during each weekend tournament. It is rivaling the famed “Baba Booey” chant.</p><p>In the end, to avoid any legal issues with PGA, Bob Menery took down all his PGA content along with the video that invited all this controversy, i.e. Matthew Wolff’s video. He erased all those videos from his Instagram account.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-25803 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bob-Menery-controversy.jpg alt="Bob Menery" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-25803 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Bob Menery in the video where he released his statement regarding the PGA controversy.
