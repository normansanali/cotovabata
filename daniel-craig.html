Just six when he caught the acting bug, he was soon appearing in school plays, encouraged by his mother who arranged visits to Liverpool's Everyman Theatre.&nbsp;</p><p id=ewXmkUf1f6 data-wc=54>In his early teens the budding actor had already decided where his career lay and at 16 he left Wirral's Hilbre High School to audition for the National Youth Theatre. He was accepted, and moved to London where his proud parents watched his stage debut as Agamemnon in the Shakespearean classic .&nbsp;</p><p id=e2UxXUCjhK- data-wc=46>After touring Europe and Russia with the Theatre, supplementing his income by working as a waiter, in 1988 he won a place at the Guidhall School of Music and Drama. Fellow classmates during his three-year stint at the prestigious academy were <a aria-label='"\"\\"\\\\"\\\\\\\\"Biography\\\\"\\"\""' class=hm-link href=#>Ewan McGregor</a> and Joseph Fiennes.&nbsp;</p><h2>What films has Daniel Craig been in?</h2><p id=exVjus55AeB data-wc=37>Daniel's film career received a kick-start with a role in . But it was his role as Geordie Peacock in the 1996 TV series that really got him noticed.&nbsp;</p><p id=e1D5r8-FkYm data-wc=35>Daniel then set his sights on Hollywood with supporting roles in 2001's alongside <a aria-label='"\"\\"\\\\"\\\\\\\\"Biography\\\\"\\"\""' class=hm-link href=#>Angelina Jolie</a> and the acclaimed in 2002, in which he teamed up with <a aria-label='"\"\\"\\\\"\\\\\\\\"Biography\\\\"\\"\""' class=hm-link href=#>Tom Hanks</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=enxvcnAiad2 data-wc=19>Two years later he turned in a star turn as the lead in critically acclaimed gangster flick .&nbsp;</p><p id=eS5R_LwNGtA data-wc=46>He was cast as James Bond in 2005 and played the iconic screen star for over 12 years. But he has also kept his work varied, appearing in films across the last almost 20 years includingand</p><p id=eB4TQhOwZuP data-wc=20>In 2019 he starred in Rian Johnson's now cult classic detective flick whose sequel was released in 2022.<br></p><h2>When did Daniel Craig become James Bond?</h2><p id=eDzYOuCN3y data-wc=63>Over a period of two years more than 200 actors, including <a aria-label='"\"\\"\\\\"\\\\\\\\"Biography\\\\"\\"\""' class=hm-link href=#>Hugh Jackman</a> and <a aria-label='"\"\\"\\\\"\\\\\\\\"Biography\\\\"\\"\""' class=hm-link href=#>Clive Owen</a>, were considered for the iconic role before 37-year-old Daniel landed it. There was mixed reaction over the choice of the ruggedly handsome blonde. But, before his first effort even hit the screens, Bond producers were impressed enough to offer him a contract to play the spy again.&nbsp;</p><p id=ep99kvUdePB data-wc=60>"It's a huge challenge," he admitted at the time. "Life is about challenges and this is one of the big ones as an actor." While significant parts in American blockbusters and Spielberg's had started to cement his growing star status, the role as James Bond marked a new beginning on the A-list for the determinately un-starry actor.</p><h2 data-gid=emrd0z1DzhG>What was Daniel Craig salary for James Bond?</h2><p id=eoHOiSxJMi data-wc=41>Reportedly, Daniel earned $3.2 million for , $7.2 million fore, $20 million for , $30 million for , and $25 million for bringing his total for the five Bond films to $85.4 million.</p><h2 data-gid=eOsC_wX9mqCh>Why is Daniel Craig leaving 007?&nbsp;</h2><p id=e3W19cq9tG data-wc=62>Daniel chose to leave the franchise behind in 2015 after Spectre. He broke his leg while filming and endured arthroscopic surgery. "I had to question myself: Was I physically capable of doing [another one] or did I want to do another one? Because that phone call to your wife saying 'I've broken my leg' is not pleasant," he said at the time.</p><p id=eRmj9_D2kK data-wc=40>He then asked producers to kill Bond off, in order for him to "move on". His Bond died at the end of No Time To Die, and producers have yet to announce a new actor to reboot the decades-long franchise.</p><h2 data-gid=eOsC_wX9mqCh>Are Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz still married?&nbsp;</h2><p id=exco6oj_er data-wc=11>Daniel's love life could be the subject of a film itself.</p><p id=eEFw6zq9RA data-wc=51>A year after graduating from the Guildhall School of Drama &nbsp;he married Scottish actress Fiona Loudon who gave birth to their daughter Ella in 1992. &nbsp;Their marriage broke down after two years, and he later began dating German-born actress Heike Makatsch, who played <a aria-label='"\"\\"\\\\"\\\\\\\\"Biography\\\\"\\"\""' class=hm-link href=#>Alan Rickman</a>'s secretary in the film</p><p id=eDivb6wdUY0 data-wc=58>After seven years their relationship ended, and rumours surfaced of a fling with his friend <a aria-label='"\"\\"\\\\"\\\\\\\\"Biography\\\\"\\"\""' class=hm-link href=#>Kate Moss</a>.
