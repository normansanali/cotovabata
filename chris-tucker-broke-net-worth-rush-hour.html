Funny, you should ask. Let’s take a look, shall we?</p><h2 id=so-what-exactly-happened-to-chris-tucker-rsquo-s-fortune><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>So, What Exactly Happened To Chris Tucker’s Fortune?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Chris Tucker</strong> travelled the unfortunate road that many celebrities have before him, the road of unpaid taxes and bad financial investments. Whether inadvertent or due to financial ignorance or perhaps even bad faith, Tucker made various bad investments thanks to his financial adviser, who also failed to provide sufficient assistance and guidance to make sure his tax duties were paid. This, of course, led to a visit from good ol’ Uncle Sam and saw The Fifth Element star having to pay a whopping <strong>$14 million </strong>back in 2014, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">and most recently <strong>$9.6 million</strong> to the IRS</a>. A massive blow and a stinging reminder of the cliché, “There’s only two things of certainty in life: death and taxes.”</p><h2 id=chris-tucker-is-making-a-comedy-comeback><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Chris Tucker Is Making A Comedy Comeback</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Chris’</strong> career began with his journey through the world of stand-up comedy and finding his spot on <strong>HBO’s</strong>Def Comedy Jam back in the early 90s. So, it should come as no surprise that the Money Talks star would venture back to what made him famous all those years ago. Back in 2012 (ish), Chris decided to do just that and embarked on a journey back to stand-up. Taking a 10+ year-long hiatus from Hollywood (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">due to the actor not wanting to make films anymore</a>) and the process of making movies, Tucker has been putting his focus on his new stand-up act. Tucker began his journey back to prominence with his Netflix special, Chris Tucker: Live.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Where Do Chris Tucker And Jackie Chan Stand Today?</a></span></p><h2 id=chris-tucker-39-s-irs-issues-stand-as-a-valuable-lesson><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Chris Tucker's IRS Issues Stand As A Valuable Lesson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his 2015 Netflix comedy special, Chris Tucker: Live,<strong>Tucker</strong> makes light of his financial situation and his poor financial acumen. He begins the whimsical rant by stating that the next person to enter his life in a romantic setting must be financially competent, “Marriage ain't sometimes a good business deal. I’m looking, though. But you know, I need a woman who gonna help me, though. I don’t care nothin’ about fine,” he continues, “You gotta do some other stuff. You gotta be able to fill out a 1099 and sh*t. You need to help me out with my taxes this year. You gotta have an accounting degree to be with me.” If you don’t laugh, you cry, right?</p><h2 id=surprisingly-chris-tucker-has-turned-down-lucrative-roles><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Surprisingly, Chris Tucker Has Turned Down Lucrative Roles</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When offers such as feature roles in Pink Panther, Lethal Weapon, and even a return offer to the Friday series come your way, you’d likely not hesitate to pounce before someone else snatches them up (with the exception possibly being Pink Panther). However, that's exactly what<strong> Chris</strong> has done in the past. For a man with his financial issues, you would think the comedian would welcome the opportunity to grab a quick and large payday with any of the aforementioned roles, especially Friday. According to Showbiz Cheatsheet.com, Tucker said this about turning down Friday, “It was about going to the next level. They couldn’t believe I didn’t want to do another one, but I was right when I think back on it,” Tucker continued, “I was like, ‘It’s time to do something new. We did that.’”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Destin Christopher Tucker Following In His Dad, Chris Tucker's Footsteps?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-tucker-39-s-cancelled-beacon-theatre-show-would-rsquo-ve-likely-paid-him-handsomely><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Chris Tucker's Cancelled Beacon Theatre Show Would’ve Likely Paid Him Handsomely</span></h2><p><strong>Chris </strong>was en route to headline a concert in New York City’s Beacon Theatre back in 2020; However, the global pandemic caused the show’s cancellation and rescheduling to a later date. The show was then rescheduled to Oct 15 of last year, but once again, the global pandemic forced another cancellation, only this time, there hasn't been an updated rescheduling(as of this writing.) There’s no telling what kind of revenue the Beacon Theatre show would’ve generated, but surely, it would’ve been a princely sum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-tucker-is-currently-worth-5-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Chris Tucker Is Currently Worth $5 million</span></h2><p>All things considered, Chris has managed to bounce back. Though nowhere near what his net worth was in previous years, Tucker has gone from a negative net worth to accumulating<strong> $5 million</strong> back in his once lonely bank account. The Rush Hour star has climbed the steep mountain back from bankruptcy; a mountain he certainly never wishes to have to climb again. However, <strong>Chris</strong> currently finds himself having a few issues with the IRS, so perhaps his past experiences regarding financial woes are, as of yet, far from over. Only time will tell.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Chris Tucker Didn’t Make A Good First Impression On Jackie Chan</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqHq1wcKknKtlkqe8rLGMp5ytZaekv7W0jKusrKBdnby2vo4%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./best-talking-pet-bird-species.html>&#171;&nbsp;10 Best Talking Pet Bird Species (With Pictures)</a>
