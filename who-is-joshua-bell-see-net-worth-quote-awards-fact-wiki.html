Joshua is a conductor and violinist, well known for his performances with various orchestras around the world. He’s been awarded numerous times and was also featured in a Washington Post experiment. All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Joshua Bell? As of mid-2016, sources estimate a net worth that is at $15 million, mostly earned through a successful career in music. He’s made many high profile performances, including in collaboration with other musicians. He’s also appeared in various television and film productions. As he continues his career, it is expected that his wealth will increase.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=joshua-bell-net-worth-15-million></span>Joshua Bell Net Worth $15 million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bell started learning the violin at the age of four, when his mother discovered that he was trying to emulate piano music by using stretched rubber bands. He was given a violin and started taking lessons, though he was also focused on other things such as sports. He studied under Donna Bricht and Mimi Zweig before learning from Josef Gingold. Despite the fact that his parents weren’t truly pushing him towards a career as a violinist, Gingold inspired Bell to pursue the instrument, so that at the age of 14, he appeared with the Philadelphia Orchestra as a solo violinist. He also attended Indiana University Jacobs School of Music to study the violin. In 1989, he achieved an Artist Diploma in Violin Performance and then a Distinguished Alumni Service Award two years after graduating from the school.</p><p>In 1985 at the age of 17, Joshua made his debut at Carnegie Hall with the St. Louis Symphony. Since then, he’s performed around the world and written numerous compositions. He took part in the film “The Red Violin” and “Ladies in Lavender”, and also made a guest appearance in “Music fo the Heart”. He is an artistic partner for the Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra and also collaborates with film composer Hans Zimmer.</p><p>He received an Academy Award nomination for his performance of the song “Before My Time” for the documentary “Chasing Ice”. Aside from those, he was named as the Music Director of the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields in London, and was also awarded the Avery Fisher Prize. One of his latest works is being part of an episode of “Royal Pains”. All have contributed to his net worth.</p><p>Bell plays a 300-year-old violin called Gibson ex Huberman – the instrument has been stolen twice but recovered. The violin was about to be sold for a collection and Joshua then decided to sell his Tom Taylor Stradivarius violin for $2 million in order to buy the violin for a little under four million dollars. The events are told in the documentary “The Return of the Violin”.</p><p>Aside from that, Bell participated in a Washington Post experiment in which he played incognito at a subway station in Washington DC. Despite his performance that could be worth significantly more in orchestra performances, he only gathered $32 and only one person knew who he was. The article and experiment would win a Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing. The experiment is also posted on YouTube, called “Find Your Way, A Busker Documentary”.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Joshua has three children born to former girlfriend Lisa Matricardi. He currently resides in Gramercy Park, Manhattan, New York.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Joshua Bell</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$15 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>December 9, 1967</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Bloomington, Indiana, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6′ (1.83 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Violinist</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Bloomington High School, North Jacobs School of Music</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Benjamin Bell, Josef Bell, Samuel Bell</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Shirley Bell, Alan P.
