accused of harassing ex-boyfriend <a href=#>Darius Jackson</a>‘s brother, Sarunas Jackson, in a restraining order request the sibling recently filed against her.</p><p>“She has gone to the media and has used her celebrity to publicly lie on my family and myself, which has resulted in death threats by the public,” Sarunas, 33, alleged in court documents filed on Jan. 19 and obtained by Page Six.</p><p>“She has harassed and stalked my friends and family [sic] social media. She has reached out to people in relation to me to lie on my family.”</p><p>Sarunas, who has had acting stints on shows like “Insecure” and “Good Trouble,” further claimed that Palmer, 30, has caused his career “damage.”</p><p>He asked that the court grant him a restraining order against the “Nope” star because he refuses to “speak with her” and doesn’t want her to comment on him or his relatives, either publicly or privately.</p><p>Sarunas concluded by alleging that the actress “has lied time and time again” and has “lured” people around him into her “web of lies.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Sarunas alleged via court docs that he and his family have received death threats because of Palmer’s “web of lies.” <span class=credit>Instagram/@keke</span></figure><p>He also provided an email from Palmer’s attorney that showed the mom of one, who shares <a href=#>11-month-old son Leodis</a> with Darius, has “legitimate concerns” about her child’s safety around her ex’s relatives.</p><p>“Sarunas (at whose home [Darius] proposes visitation takes place) has been accused of domestic violence by his spouse, including choking her in front of their daughter, and that there have been allegations of sexual abuse,” the letter states.</p><p>“These are not things that Keke takes lightly, and an attempt by Darius to prematurely eliminate the monitor and give his family free reign around Leo will be vigorously opposed.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Palmer is in the midst of a custody battle with Darius. <span class=credit>WireImage</span></figure><p>Sarunas’ ex DomiNque Perry accused the actor of “mental and physical abuse,” claiming in a November 2023 filing<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> obtained by USA Today</a> that he repeatedly called her “stupid” during an argument.</p><p>“I then said to him, ‘You talk to your mother like that not me’ at that point he became more angry and grabbed me by the throat and started choking me,” the “American Hero” actress claimed. “I was in such shock and disbelief.”</p><p>Sarunas, however, denied the allegations, stating at the time via a court filing, “It is unclear where Respondent’s allegations of emotional volatility and intimidation are coming from.</p><p>“My family and I have always welcomed Respondent with open arms, inviting her to family events and showing her love and support in more ways than one. In return, Respondent has defamed my character to others, making them believe I am an absent father.”</p><p>However, last November, Palmer’s mother, Sharon Palmer, claimed Sarunas <a href=#>had admitted to her</a> that he had an abusive past.</p><p>.</p><p>“I went to Sarunas over a year ago and told him that his brother was abusive to my daughter, and he said, ‘Well, I used to be like that too,’” she alleged via Instagram at the time.</p><p>“So now he’s posting on Twitter like he’s this special guy when we know he’s the biggest f–kboy in Hollywood; he’s disrespectful to women just like his brother.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Keke’s mother previously claimed Sarunas admitted to being abusive like his brother. <span class=credit>Getty Images for Alo Yoga</span></figure><p>Sarunas’ request against Keke has been temporarily denied. The court decided that the temporary restraining order should not be granted until a court hearing on the matter takes place on Feb. 7.</p><p>Court documents obtained by Page Six state there was “insufficient evidence that great irreparable harm would result” if the order was not issued.</p><p>Page Six has reached out to Palmer’s reps for comment but did not immediately hear back.</p><p>The latest legal dispute comes as the “Password” host is still in the throes of her own battle with Darius.</p><p>In October 2023, Palmer <a href=#>filed for full legal and physical custody</a> of Leodis and also <a href=#>sought a restraining order</a> against Darius at the time, claiming that he has been abusive to her throughout their relationship.</p><p>She <a href=#>provided authorities with security footage</a> of him allegedly grabbing her by the neck during a dispute and was <a href=#>granted the restraining order </a>shortly after. It was <a href=#>recently extended to six more months</a> while the exes settle their child custody issues.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-full">Sarunas was temporarily denied his restraining order against Keke. <span class=credit>Dave Benett/Getty Images for Michael Venom Page</span></figure><p>Meanwhile, Darius has alleged that <a href=#>he has been a victim of Keke’s abuse</a>, claiming the star once “punched” him in the face at a birthday party. It does not appear she has responded to the claims.</p><p>However, a source told Page Six in December 2023 that a criminal investigation is ongoing and Keke, in the meantime, is <a href=#>continuing to “protect her safety</a> and the safety of Leo above all else.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXOAjmloaGpjZLCmuMSbqaKsqWK7psPSaKKeo5VivaK4zJ6prGWVrXqlrdGirKxlmpawrL%2FOp6pmmqKkwamx0WadoqSVqHqzsdKtqZqhnp67qHnOq5ueql2WtKK1zayrZqafpbJuv9OaqWg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./mappa-s-use-cgi-chainsaw-man-anime-causes-controversy.html>&#171;&nbsp;MAPPA's use of CGI in Chainsaw Man anime causes controversy</a>
