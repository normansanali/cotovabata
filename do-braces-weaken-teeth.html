Braces can be a good option for those with poor periodontal health. Excessive force in orthodontic treatment with Invisalign or braces can cause severe damage to the root and pulp of teeth as well as the supporting bones.<h2>What are the negative effects of braces?</h2><p>Common Side Effects of Braces</p><ul><li>Mild Discomfort.

Besides, straighter teeth from braces don't only make your smile better and more dazzling. They can also be stronger and less prone to diseases. They can even help make your gums healthier!<h2>Can braces damage roots of teeth?</h2>A minimal amount of root resorption can occur with people who undergo treatment with braces. As with everything in life, there's always a risk for complications. However, complications associated with root resorption are few and far between.<h2>DO BRACES MAKE TEETH LOOSE? DO BRACES CAUSE DAMAGE TO TEETH? ASK BRACES SPECIALIST DR SONAHITA</h2><p></p><h2>Can braces cause long term damage?</h2>This can cause damage to the enamel surface of the teeth, causing discoloration of the teeth or the appearance of white marks known as decalcification. Additionally, it may also lead to tooth decay and gum disease in some cases.<h2>Do braces change your face?</h2>Yes, undergoing orthodontic treatment can bring changes to a person's face. Don't worry though – the changes that braces will make are purely positive! Braces will fix alignment issues with your face and give you a more symmetrical, natural look to both your mouth and your jawline.<h2>What are the pros and cons of having braces?</h2><p>5 Things You Should Know About Adult Braces: The Pros and Cons</p><ul><li>Pro: teeth will look and feel better. ...</li><li>Con: treatment takes longer for adults. ...</li><li>Pro: reduces the risk of other dental problems. ...</li><li>Con: could reveal other dental issues. ...</li><li>Pro: adults make better patients.</li></ul><h2>Are straight teeth healthier?</h2>Straight Teeth Protect Your Overall Health<p>Bacteria that attacks the gum tissue doesn't have to stop there. It can also travel through the blood vessels and enter your blood stream. Once there, it can damage your arteries, increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke, and other serious health conditions.</p><h2>What is the best age for braces?</h2>However, a general rule of thumb is your kids should look at getting braces between the ages of 9 and 14. Usually, this is before they've gone through puberty. If they've already gone through it, this means it'll be harder to adjust their jaw and/or teeth, as they've already settled into their post-puberty positions.<h2>Does your lip shape change after braces?</h2>To summarise, braces can indeed change the position of your lips, but only as much as the teeth behind them change. However, braces cannot change your lips as far as the fullness, tone and shape of your lips are concerned.<h2>Do braces permanently straighten teeth?</h2>For most people, braces are the safest and most effective way to permanently straighten their teeth. If your teeth are only slightly crooked or just a bit crowded, an orthodontist-prescribed retainer may be enough to get them straight.<h2>Is Invisalign better than braces?</h2>Braces are better for people with severe crookedness and most kids and teens. Invisalign and other brands of clear aligners are best for adults who want a nearly invisible and more comfortable straightening method, as long as the teeth aren't too crooked.<h2>Why are straight teeth attractive?</h2>Results of the study indicated Americans perceive people with straight teeth to have more desirable qualities than those with crooked teeth, including attributes such as being happy, surrounded by loved ones, and professionally successful.<h2>What are the benefits of braces?</h2><p>What are the Benefits of Wearing Braces?</p><ul><li>Alleviation of Speech Impairment. Did you know that disproportionate teeth have an impact on the way we sound out words? ...</li><li>Braces are Beneficial in Preventing Bone Erosion. ...</li><li>Braces Aid Digestion. ...</li><li>Braces Help Improve Your Overall Oral Health. ...</li><li>Braces Provide a Confidence Boost.</li></ul><h2>Why do I regret getting braces?</h2>The most common regret of people who had braces many years ago is the movement of their teeth. Parents of patients often tell us they had a perfect smile after braces but it has changed over the years.<h2>What happens if you wear braces for too long?</h2>If brackets remain in place for years, plaque could build-up in places that are hard to reach, eventually leading to tooth decay and gum disease. Some Brackets May Later Dislodge– Under normal circumstances, when a bracket dislodges, your orthodontist will reattach it.<h2>Do braces make your lips bigger?</h2>Do Braces Change Your Lips and Make Them Look Bigger? Yes, braces can change the position of your lips, but only as much as the teeth immediately behind them change. It has nothing to do with braces changing your lips as far as fullness or shape.<h2>Do braces make your jawline sharper?</h2>Braces are used alongside other orthodontic appliances to help widen the jaw and even improve the jawline. If you have crooked teeth or a misaligned bite, it could be due to an overbite or an underbite. You don't need to worry, though, as there are treatments that can help restore your jawline.<h2>Do braces change your nose?</h2>No, orthodontic treatment, including Invisalign and braces, does not directly impact your nose or lengthen your face. The reason people occasionally think their nose looks different after braces or their face seems to have lengthened is about the angles.<h2>Do guys like braces on a girl?</h2>The answer is yes — guys find girls with braces attractive. Why? Someone finding you attractive is only a tiny bit related to whether or not he finds you physically stunning right off the bat. I know it's cliche to say that it's an inner thing — but it's true.<h2>Are braces worth it?</h2>Although braces may seem expensive, the results of wearing braces far outweigh the price. In fact, braces may soon become one of the most rewarding investments you can make for your oral health and self-confidence. So, are braces worth it? The answer is yes.<h2>Is it better to get braces younger?</h2>Early adolescence, or between the ages of 10 and 14, is widely considered the ideal time to get braces. That's because preteens and younger teens have all (or nearly all) of their adult teeth in place, and their softer jawbone tissue is still quite responsive to repositioning.<h2>How long do braces last?</h2>Most patients will need to wear fixed braces for around 18 to 24 months. For problems that are harder to correct, or for our older patients, treatment may take up to three years. If you have less severe issues or are a good candidate for clear aligners like Invisalign, treatment may take as little as 6 to 12 months.<h2>What's the average time you wear braces?</h2>On average, it takes about 24 months to complete an orthodontic treatment. Some patients require less than 12 months, but there are also patients requiring up to 3 years of treatment before their teeth reach the desired position. Orthodontics is not a one-size-fits-all solution and each patient's mouth is unique.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye8OoZJuqkZiytHnWnpiknZ5iwaax06E%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./how-old-was-anderson-silva-when-he-lost-to-chris-weidman.html>&#171;&nbsp;How Old Was Anderson Silva When He Lost to Chris Weidman?</a>
