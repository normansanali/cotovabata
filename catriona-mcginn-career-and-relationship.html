Paul, her spouse, gained notoriety for his performance in Saved by the Bell as a young actor. Gosselaar even took home the Young Artist Award for his performance.</strong></p><h2><span id=How_Much_Is_The_Net_Worth_of_Catriona_McGinn>How Much Is The Net Worth of Catriona McGinn?</span></h2><p>Her current net worth as of 2022 is $3 million. Given that Catriona holds a senior role in her company, this information should come as no surprise.</p><p>Additionally, Mark, McGinn’s spouse, is worth $8 million in total. The four members of the family dwell in Santa Clarita Valley.</p><h2><span id=Wiki-Bio_of_Catriona_McGinn_Gosselaar_An_Account_of_Her_Early_Years>Wiki-Bio of Catriona McGinn Gosselaar: An Account of Her Early Years</span></h2><p>On June 22, 1978, Catriona Hope McGinn was born in Canada. Following her marriage to American Mark, she obtained dual citizenship with the United States and Canada. She is of Irish descent and is a member of the Caucasian ethnic group.</p><p>Her parents raised the famous wife in Canada. Due to her extreme privacy, not much information about her parents and siblings is available.</p><h2><span id=Gosselaar_Catriona_McGinn_Education>Gosselaar, Catriona McGinn Education</span></h2><p>In 1998, after graduating from high school, Catriona enrolled at McGill University to pursue a bachelor’s degree. In 2002, she obtained her Bachelor’s degree in Psychology and Communication. Her majors were in Cognitive & Child Psychology and Media Studies.</p><p>After that, Canadian student AD Catriona attended Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. She studied advertising, public relations, and applied communication at the college.</p><p>Considering her educational background, it’s reasonable to assume Catriona is highly intelligent. The fact that Catriona consistently prevails in their debates should go without saying.</p><h2><span id=Is_Catriona_McGinn8217s_Career_As_An_Actress_As_Her_Spouse>Is Catriona McGinn’s Career As An Actress As Her Spouse?</span></h2><p>Fans of the attractive heartthrob Mark assumed Catriona would work as an actor or model when they saw him propose to her.

She began working for the company in 2010 and has held the positions of Director of Sales & Marketing and Co-Founder ever since. In addition, she is employed with Jeff Lewis Design as an Associate in Interior Design.</p><p>It is clear from the brief overview of her work background that she is a complex person.

We’re attempting to keep it as conventional as we can. It’s going to be enjoyable!</p><p>“We are going to eat our ass a––es off,” the Saved By the Bell star continued. We’re very enthusiastic about that component.</p><p>August 2011 harked the beginning of the couple’s engagement. With a stunning 5-carat cushion-cut diamond ring, the Franklin & Bash star proposed to this special someone. Neil Lane, a friend of Mark’s, created the band on demand.</p><p>He couldn’t wait to pop the question, according to a source at the time of his engagement.

The couple reportedly initially crossed paths in the 1990s.</p><p>The couple’s connection resulted in the birth of two lovely children.
