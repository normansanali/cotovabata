According to the Daily Mail, Morello said:</p><p>It’s always very interesting reading the comments on my Eid tutorials because at the end of the video I put a hijab on just to show you how the makeup will look. I’m an atheist … and I’m not trying to promote any religion here. I’m just trying to promote acceptance.</p><p>She then acknowledged that she was very aware of the discrimination many Muslim people face. She then said:</p><p>It makes as much sense as it does to do a Christmas tutorial to do an Eid tutorial. It’s really not a big deal. People are making a big deal out of a video that’s nice to be appreciative but it should be normal … as in it should be normal for Islamic women to feel a part of society.</p><p>According to Morello, her Eid tutorials in the past have always been received well. “Some girl said I was culturally appropriating Islam by putting a hijab on,” she said. “Can I just say I don’t want to wear a hijab as an accessory … I’m putting it on so you can see how it looks with the makeup.”</p><p>Other than that she doesn’t like to be in any controversy. She likes to keep her life private.</p><h2><span id=Chloe_Morello_8211_Body_Measurements>Chloe Morello – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Chloe Morello has a <strong>height</strong> of 5 feet 7 inches (170 cm) and a weight of 53 kg (116 lbs).
