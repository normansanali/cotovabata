General Assembly to mark the observance of ‘Nelson Mandela International Day’, Prince Harry chose to condemn the United States for ‘contributing to a global assault on democracy and freedom.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It was a rambling, unfocused speech.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to Prince Harry, counted among the worst catastrophes plaguing the world right now are the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, lies and disinformation, the war in Ukraine and… the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe versus Wade.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Or at least, that’s what his audience was left to believe.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘From the horrific war in Ukraine to the rolling back of a constitutional right in the U.S., we are witnessing a global assault on democracy and freedom — the cause of Mandela’s life,’ he droned in his nearly 30-minute remarks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Excuse me?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Which one of these is not like the other?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>COVID has killed more than 6.3 million people worldwide. The war in Ukraine has killed tens of thousands. And the Supreme Court handed down a decision consistent with a widespread interpretation of the U.S. Constitution.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async id=i-2e00cf87f710356d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/18/22/60418837-11025959-image-a-1_1658179663861.jpg height=423 width=634 alt="In a keynote address Monday before the United Nations General Assembly to mark the observance of ¿Nelson Mandela International Day¿, Prince Harry chose to condemn the United States for ¿contributing to a global assault on democracy and freedom.¿" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>In a keynote address Monday before the United Nations General Assembly to mark the observance of ‘Nelson Mandela International Day’, Prince Harry chose to condemn the United States for ‘contributing to a global assault on democracy and freedom.’</p><img decoding=async id=i-4421dbffb2de565e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/18/22/60408759-11025959-The_Desmond_Leah_Tutu_Legacy_Foundation_gave_the_Duke_and_Duches-a-2_1658179673247.jpg height=422 width=634 alt="Today was a missed opportunity to keep the focus on one of the truly great global leaders of all time, Nelson Mandela (seen in photo with Princess Diana)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p></p><p class=imageCaption>Today was a missed opportunity to keep the focus on one of the truly great global leaders of all time, Nelson Mandela (seen in photo with Princess Diana)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Those are not in the same league.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The speech was confusing and wildly insulting to the undoubtably few Americans, who may have been watching.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>It is hard for me to understand why anyone should care what the Duke of Sussex thinks – let alone what he thinks about America.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He has lived here all of 20 minutes, yet he has decided that makes him an expert.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Being a Duke (or a Duchess for that matter) means next to nothing in America. It confers nothing other than superficial celebrity clout and social media clicks.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Just because one may disagree with the outcome of a Supreme Court ruling, does not make it a threat to democracy.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If Harry ever voted in an U.S. election, maybe he would have known that. But of course, he hasn’t because he is not a citizen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The Supreme Court decision overturning Roe and returning the power to determine abortion policy to the states is not a threat to democracy – that is democracy in action.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But this isn’t the first time that Harry has exhibited a complete misunderstanding of the civic life of the country in which he now lives.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’ve got so much I want to say about the First Amendment as I sort of understand it, but it is bonkers,’ he blathered on a podcast last year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I don’t want to start going down the First Amendment route because that’s a huge subject and one which I don’t understand because I’ve only been here a short time, but you can find a loophole in anything.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That’s right Harry. Maybe you shouldn’t be talking about the First Amendment or any amendment for that matter.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The exhausting thing about Harry is that it seems like all the Duke does in America is virtue-signal, lecture and deride the Constitution.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Harry and Meghan Markel chose to seek woke-asylum here in the United States because — as they infamously told the world — the Royal family was just too racist to endure.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>So, they fled the horrors of pampered royal life to live a pampered celebrity life in a sprawling multimillion dollar mansion, surrounded by the wealthiest and woke-est our country has to offer.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Maybe he needs reminding that he is a guest here and not a guest who has been universally embraced by the American public.</p><img decoding=async id=i-b17d8548b1fcd69d src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/18/22/58627687-11025959-A_bombshell_new_book_claims_that_the_Queen_told_her_closest_aide-a-5_1658179730432.jpg height=440 width=634 alt="Harry and Meghan Markel chose to seek woke-asylum here in the United States because -- as they infamously told the world -- the Royal family was just too racist to endure.

In fact, my country went to war against yours so that we’d never have to be subject to a royal lecture ever again.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The American Constitution is a sacred blueprint upon which this country thrives. It is what makes democracy possible.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Finally, and probably most egregiously, Prince Harry is a hypocrite.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Like so many others who spread the religion of climate change, he flies around the world on a carbon spewing private jet.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>He and his family jetted back across the pond to attend the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee onboard a 13-passenger Bombardier Global 600 jet.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to emissions experts, their flight emitted 60 tons of carbon – that’s 10 times more carbon than a commercial flight.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>I find few things as distasteful and disrespectful as a foreigner living in another country and having the hubris to trash it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The question I have for Harry is: What country is good enough for you?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>If the UK is a cesspool of racism and America is a contributor to an assault on democracy and freedom, what is good enough Mr. Prince?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Because the God-fearing, gun-yielding, Constitution-loving, monarchy-hating majority in America love it here.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Yes, we have some serious issues that we must deal with.</p><img decoding=async id=i-8ee2acb245082d2c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/07/18/22/60406093-11025959-Members_of_the_UN_watched_on_as_the_Duke_of_Sussex_gave_his_spee-a-10_1658179833107.jpg height=422 width=634 alt="I for one am sick of this and sick of him.
