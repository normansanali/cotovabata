But Ghost Protocol and its antecedents — 2015’s Rogue Nation and 2018’s Fallout, the fifth and sixth entries into the franchise, respectively — didn’t just propose audiences watch the savior of cinema dangle from various extremely high things on any screens, they suggested audiences do so on the biggest, most dynamic screens they could possibly find. A decade ago, that meant IMAX. Today, with the seventh M:I movie upon us, there are myriad options: you can see <a href=#>Dead Reckoning Part One</a> on a big screen (Standard Digital Projection), on a gigantic screen (IMAX), on a really big screen (RPX), on a stretched (ScreenX), or in pure chaos (4DX). To help you avoid choice paralysis, I spent the better part of one week watching Dead Reckoning in every format available to me in New York City.

IMAX was primarily used for short documentary films until Christopher Nolan decided to shoot roughly half an hour of 2008’s The Dark Knight on large, loud, unwieldy, and expensive IMAX cameras. The resulting images aren’t just clearer, thanks to the film stock (65mm, as opposed to traditional 35mm film), they are taller (IMAX screens take up a more square-like 4:3 ratio, as opposed to a wider, more typical 2.39:1).</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk31u3zy00543b6vmfxp7zvs@published data-word-count=121>So which M:I movies were intended to be experienced in IMAX? Some, but not all, of Ghost Protocol and Fallout, was shot on 65mm film and so the movie is described as “filmed for IMAX.” Dead Reckoning used IMAX-certified cameras, but not 65mm film, and is therefore described as “shot for IMAX.” Rogue Nation was only “digitally re-mastered into the image and sound quality of an IMAX Experience.” It’s all a bit confusing. (Just take a look at <a href=#>this press release</a> explaining Dune’s two very different IMAX experiences or <a href=#>this interview</a> in which Christopher Nolan details the many ways to see Oppenheimer!) The catch: only films shot on IMAX’s 65mm film were actually meant to fill that very tall IMAX screen.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk31u40400553b6vr7f82uja@published>Why Should I See Dead Reckoning in IMAX?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk31u40400563b6vae65dqx8@published data-word-count=115>None of Tom Cruise’s death defying acts in Dead Reckoning were filmed to fill a several-story screen, but there’s another selling point to the IMAX experience: the sound quality.

If you must spend roughly twice the amount of a standard movie ticket, this is the best way to experience Dead Reckoning. So just let that IMAX propaganda pour over you. By the time you’ve gone from the box office to the ticket taker to the concession stand to the actual auditorium, you’ll have passed so many IMAX logos and IMAX movie posters that you’ll never watch an Image Minimum movie again.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk31u40400573b6vv9rux2p2@published>Why Shouldn’t I See Dead Reckoning in IMAX?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk31u40400583b6v7tpr522g@published data-word-count=63>Consider your bladder.

And I can’t stress this enough: know your bladder. This movie is two hours and forty-five minutes. Getting up and sneaking out isn’t treacherous when your auditorium has generous walking space.

A con artist really convinced hundreds of theaters to chop their films into three pieces and call the whole thing a “premium experience.” Because this isn’t the gentle roundness of a planetarium or domed IMAX screen — it’s a movie projected across three white walls connected at 90-degree angles. There’s nothing graceful about ScreenX! <a href=#>This piece</a> referred to the experience as “IMAX but sideways.” Which is to say… it’s disorienting. You’re constantly tempted to look at the side screens but never rewarded for the effort. I’ve seen two movies in this format, both of which were visually spectacular — Elvis and Dead Reckoning — and can confidently say the peculiar cropping and jarring stretching of the frame’s edges was at best a distraction, and at worst just plain ugly.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk31u405005d3b6v7r8ik553@published>Why Should I See Dead Reckoninge in ScreenX?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk31u405005e3b6viz7ibd0j@published data-word-count=63>I don’t know, because you subscribe to Variety, listen to The Town, or are just really into the wackadoo business of Hollywood?

Chase scenes that looked stunning in all the other formats had an uncanny veneer in ScreenX, as if I could make out every individual layer of CGI. What felt like a true blockbuster in other formats felt more like an expensive episode of television projected in someone’s basement in ScreenX. Even worse, the sound seemed&nbsp;to be coming exclusively from the front of the auditorium,&nbsp;as if the surround mix had been condensed into simple stereo. A common plea from action movie marketers these days is to “SEE OUR MOVIE ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE.” They’re right, and that’s a good line. You know what isn’t a good line? “SEE OUR MOVIE ON THE LONGEST SCREEN POSSIBLE, PROJECTED FROM THREE PROJECTORS ONTO THREE WALLS, TWO OF WHICH ARE BASKING IN RED GLOW OF ‘EXIT’ SIGNS BECAUSE NOT EVEN THE MAGIC OF CINEMA CAN OVERRIDE FIRE CODE.”</p><h2 class="clay-subheader_fancy hanging-item" data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk31u407005r3b6vum3ckcgg@published><span class=unordered-list-item><p class=list-item-text>.</p></span>Option #5: Utter Chaos</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src> You’ll be self-destructing in the first five seconds.<h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk3gxhy400j23b6v2azf5dfm@published>What Is 4DX?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk31u407005s3b6v97soaymu@published data-word-count=25>There’s a scene in Fallout when an IMF courier delivers a message to Ethan in his safehouse.

Large seats with retractable footrests are synchronized to the action on screen, creating a distressing ballet of three primary experiences: movement (the chairs rock from side to side and front to back and the seat backs are like roided-out massage devices, prodding you in the general area where a character is receiving a punch or kick onscreen), wind (if there’s wind in a scene, it will be windy in the theater), and mist (if someone gets wet in a scene, you will be sprayed in the face like a misbehaving cat).

Go for it, freak.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/clk31u40800613b6vxqj1exnj@published>Why Shouldn’t I See Dead Reckoning in 4DX?</h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clk31u40800623b6vuzicdipc@published data-word-count=170>I spilled an ounce or so of Pepsi Zero on myself during one of the first seat rumblings, leaving me afraid of my Pepsi Zero for the next two and a half hours. Imagine being afraid of your Pepsi Zero! The nonstop wind effect during a scene in the Arabian desert was so cold it numbed my fingertips for the remainder of the movie. Because the screening was nearly empty, the intermittent bangs of dozens and dozens of retractable footrests falling was jarring. During a relentless chase sequence in Rome, it almost felt like Regal Union Square was going to collapse right into the N/Q/R/W line. 4DX is fantastic for horror movies, where the jolts and jostles only add to the surprise of a jumpscare. I could see it being sort of fun for a more typical action movie that takes occasional breaks from the insanity. But for a movie like this, one that almost never gives its characters time to breathe, 4DX is a stomach issue waiting to happen.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>How to Watch Mission: Impossible 7 in a Movie Theater</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmny4tMicn2ark6eyprqMrJ%2BorZyZeqp50p6cZqVdnoRuu81nn62lnA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./karen-carpenter.html>&#171;&nbsp;Karen Carpenter</a>
