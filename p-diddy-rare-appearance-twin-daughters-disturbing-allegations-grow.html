The pop star accused him of assaulting her in 2018, including allegations of rape, physical abuse, coercing her to carry a firearm to intimidate her, among many disturbing claims. Notably, <a href=#>Cassie’s lawsuit against Combs was swiftly settled</a> just a day after its filing, with the terms of the settlement remaining undisclosed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, the recent accusations are part of a broader pattern of legal challenges against Combs that span back to the 1990s, coinciding with the inception of his record label, Bad Boy Records.</p><p>Puff Daddy, also known as P. Diddy or Sean Combs, carved an iconic career in the music industry as a rapper, producer, and entrepreneur. Rising to prominence in the 1990s, he founded Bad Boy Records, a label credited with launching the careers of several prominent artists. Combs is known his hit singles like "I'll Be Missing You" and "Mo Money Mo Problems." Over the years, he has diversified his ventures, including fashion, acting, and liquor branding.</p><p>While he’s faced various accusations and lawsuits over the years, the mounting lawsuits against him may represent a turn in his career and tarnish his reputation.
