Maddison Jaizani is a well-known British actress. In addition, she works as a model. Maddison is well-known for her tremendous skills as an actor and model, and she has over a million social media followers. Jaizani’s passionate fans are always keen to discover more about her, so read on to learn more about her parents.</p><h2>Maddison Jaizani’s parents: Falah Al-Jaizani and Tracey Stafford</h2><p>The prominent model <strong>Maddison Jaizani’s</strong> father is Falah Al-Jaizani, and her mother is Tracey Stafford. On June 3, 1995, in London, England, the lovely model was born to an English mother and an Iranian father. She grew raised in Sale, Greater Manchester, with her parents and spent most of her youth there. Aside from her parents’ identities, nothing is known about their professional lives.</p><p>The actress is the family’s oldest child, with two younger brothers, Milan and Gabe. However, since Maddison is a private person, just the names of her brothers have been released.&nbsp;She attended Sir John Deane’s College for sixth form. Under the tutelage of her parents, she graduated from Bury College in 2014 with a BTEC Extended Diploma in performing arts.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Maddison-Jaizani-1.jpg alt="Maddison Jaizani" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Maddison Jaizani’s Husband: Is She Married?</h2><p><strong>Maddison Jaizani</strong>, the stunning actress, is single as of 2023. Several rumors, however, imply that she is married to John Ross, but no formal declaration has been made.&nbsp;Luke Pasqualino, a well-known English actor, has also been associated with Maddison, according to rumors. He rose to prominence as Freddie McClair in the TV series Skins.</p><p>She tweeted a selfie of the two of them on June 17, 2017, in which she was riding on Luke’s back while he was wearing a boxer.&nbsp;She also posted a snapshot of them on Instagram in 2018 when visiting Spain for the Spanish Getaway. Due to their difficulty to be seen together and the absence of news about them, the two do not seem to be dating at the moment.&nbsp;As a result, they might be dating or have split up. Unless Maddison shares any details about their relationship, it is logical to believe she is single.</p><h2>Maddison Jaizani Net Worth: How Much Money Does She Make?</h2><p>Jaizani’s acting and modeling careers have earned her a lot of money. Her net worth is expected to be substantial by 2023, although the actress has yet to share her exact net worth.&nbsp;The renowned model began working in the entertainment industry in 2014 and has swiftly collected thousands of dollars.&nbsp;She also generates money on Instagram, where she now has over 86.5K followers, via sponsorship deals and promotional activities.</p><p>The actress has collaborated with brands such as Levis and GUCCI.&nbsp;However, owing to her reputation and expertise as an actress and model, she may earn several thousand dollars every year. As a consequence, given her salary and net worth, she should be able to live comfortably.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Maddison-Jaizani-2.jpg alt="Maddison Jaizani" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Maddison Jaizani Breakthrough Roles in Acting and Modeling</h2><p>Maddison Jaizani debuted as a professional actor in 2014.
