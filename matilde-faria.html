It was in the past due to the rumors of José Mourinho’s rumored disloyalty. In the year 2007, soon after Mourinho was out from Chelsea, ‘The Sun’ had announced that José had an affair with Elsa Sousa. In one of the interviews, she shared private information regarding the affair telling how he fed her chocolate-chip cookies when they were listening to Bryan Adams ‘Everything I Do, I Do It For You’. Both José and she agreed that the statements were all fake.</p><p>Then, in the year 2010, another controversy took place after a Kenyan woman named Lelesit Silvana alleged that she had an affair with Mousinho when he went to Diani. The two of them also went on several romantic holiday trips to Poland. Moreover, she alleged that he was even ready to leave his wife and had asked her for marriage. Once again, she and her husband disagreed on the claims. Then, when Faria had to go through an emergency operation in late December 2016, it was José’s chance to prove himself innocent. José Mourinho’s loyalty to his wife, as well as his family, has surely shut down all those rumors.</p><h2><span id=Matilde_Faria_8211_Body_Measurement>Matilde Faria – Body Measurement</span></h2><p>Regarding the celebrity wife’s body measurement, Maltilde has an average <strong>height</strong> of 5 feet 5 inches or else 165 cm or 1.65 m.
