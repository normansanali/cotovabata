The Truth Revealed!</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><strong>Inside Joseline Hernandez's tumultuous love life: Who is she dating in 2023? &nbsp;</strong></p><p>A television personality, rapper, and actress, <strong>Joseline Hernandez</strong>, best known for starring in the drama-filled series <i>Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta, is in the </i>process<i> </i>of building a stellar television career. Since shooting to fame with the Love & Hip Hop franchise, Hernandez has achieved a lot, including launching her music career and showing her acting chops in several shows. &nbsp;</p><p>Born on November 3, 1986, in Ponce, Puerto Rico, Hernandez endured a poverty and violence-stricken early life. After her father's death from a heroin overdose, a 6-year-old Joseline moved to Miami in pursuit of a better life. She joined the entertainment industry as an exotic dancer before being discovered by producer<strong> Stevie </strong>J, who will help her propel to stardom. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>What is Joseline Hernandez's Relationship Status in 2023? &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Hernandez may have found her other half. The<i> Love & Hip Hop </i>star has been in a committed relationship with <strong>DJ Ballistics</strong>, whose real name is Robin Ingouma, since 2019. Some might have assumed that the duo had broken up since Joseline's life has been all about contentious incidents and lawsuits lately, but the two are reportedly still going strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/12/385385884_825677086229697_1334081523968693980_n%20(1)%20(1)-1702401873681.jpg><p>Hernandez and Ballistics first came to the news for their alleged romance in April 2019. The stripper-turned-tv-personality had just gotten out of a long-term relationship and was even involved in some suspected flings when she started romance rumors with Ballistics. &nbsp;</p><p>Joseline, being the vociferous personality that she is, didn't take long to confirm the swirling rumors with the Miami-based DJ. "He knows I love him," Joseline captioned a video in April. The couple regularly flaunts their relationship and their lavish lifestyle on Instagram. The self-proclaimed Puerto Rican princess recently commemorated her man's birthday. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/12/397983095_731650035443955_6460673020805870218_n%20(1)%20(1)-1702401880316.jpg><p>"9/11 is your bday! @balisticbeats. Five years strong and a lifetime to go! HAPPY BIRTHDAY," wrote Hernandez while sharing a carousel of snaps and videos, perfectly capturing the duo's unbreakable bond. The pair have seemingly gotten engaged since. &nbsp;</p><p>In September 2019, DJ Ballistics shared a screenshot of Joseline's loved-up message to him where she calls herself his "fiancé." "I will honor you, I will love you, I will take care of you, I'll be loyal and make the best love to you," Joseline's<a href=#> message </a>in the post read. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>The couple faced a $25 million lawsuit last year!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Although the couple has not announced their wedding date, they've already been embroiled in a bombshell scandal. Last year, the duo was slapped with a <i>$25 million</i><a href=#> lawsuit</a> by cast members of Zeus Network's reality series, <i>Joseline's Cabaret</i>, which shows Hernandez visiting different cities every season and helping women become cabaret dancers. &nbsp;</p><p>While Hernandez and her beau vehemently denied the accusations, the plaintiffs alleged that the couple attacked them during the filming of the show. The alleged victims have since dropped the suit, saying that they've decided to move on from the ordeal. &nbsp;</p><h3>Get to Know Joseline Hernandez's Soon-to-be Husband, DJ Ballistics! &nbsp; &nbsp;</h3><p>DJ Ballistics has noticeably been Joseline's rock ever since they started dating. Hence, it is natural for the television star's fans to pry into the DJ's life. Besides working as a DJ, Ballistics is also a music producer. He has worked with <strong>Tamar Braxton, Serayah, Jazza Pha,</strong> and fellow producer <strong>Prince Charles</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/12/377839486_333614392441287_6910665653403788106_n%20(1)%20(1)-1702401903364.jpg><p>Since going official with television's Puerto Rican princess, Ballistics has moved in with Joseline to the Sunshine State of Miami, although he originally hails from Philadelphia. The loved-up couple don't miss a chance to show off their thriving relationship and Ballistics' strong father-like bond with Hernandez's daughter from her previous relationship, making fans believe that the pair's wedding might be an imminent celebration. &nbsp;</p><h3>The Truth About Joseline Hernandez and Steve J's Relationship! &nbsp;</h3><p>Hernandez's tumultuous relationship with producer Steve J is a widely covered topic. Most of Joseling-starring reality TV shows have touched on her infamous relationship with the Grammy-winning producer, who had welcomed five kids with four different women before they started dating. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/12/382259677_304736442201028_6055169268343541041_n%20(1)%20(1)-1702401928650.jpg><p>Joseline met Steve when she started her showbiz journey as a stripper. Under Steve's guidance, Hernandez would foray into the glamour world and soon land her break in <i>Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta</i> in 2012. Hernandez's entry into reality television was drama-inducing as it showcased her messy love triangle with Steve and his then-girlfriend, <strong>Mimi Faust.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>Steve would eventually call it off with Faust and go official with Joseline on television. During their relatively enduring relationship, which began scandalously in 2012 and ended in 2016, Joseline and Steve claimed to be married at a time. The couple later revealed that their marriage was a sham. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/12/377439926_2418535415012412_7608074553054374253_n%20(1)%20(1)-1702401943041.jpg><p>The duo welcomed a daughter, <strong>Bonnie Bella Hernandez</strong>, in December 2016, but the pair had broken up by then. The estranged couple, hence, went on to be embroiled in a contentious custody battle of their daughter. Hernandez shared that she and her daughter's daddy have since called a truce. &nbsp;</p><p>"Her dad and I and Balistic and [Faith Evans], we're so cool," Joseline said while dishing on her extended family, which includes Steve's spouse, <strong>Faith Evans,</strong> and her current beau, Ballistics. "We're co-parenting, and it's just like, it's easy, it's fun, and it should be simple," said the television star. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqOmrJ2cnrumeceeqaeZnpmyu3nSoqWgpJViwaK3xKdkqKpdnsG0ecKopKmkmZiutbHDZquhnV2pv7bAx2apnq6VlrmmsA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./summer-house-stars-who-left-the-show-where-are-they-now.html>&#171;&nbsp;Summer House Stars Who Left the Show: Where Are They Now?</a>
