Some love seeing Swift cheer him on and get excited when pictures appear online of their outings. Others, however, wish that Swift was not a focus during Chiefs' games. Regardless, it is interesting to watch Swift interact with those closest to Kelce while he's on the field.

While that mostly includes his friends and <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes' wife Brittany</a>, both of Travis Kelce's parents have also been in attendance.</p><p>However, Kelce wished that his father, Ed Kelce, specifically, had not spoken with his new love interest.
