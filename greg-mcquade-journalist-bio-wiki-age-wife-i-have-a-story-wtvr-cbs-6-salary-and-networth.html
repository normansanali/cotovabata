The job prepared him well for a career in broadcasting. In a small market like Bangor you work long hours, shoot the pictures, write the story, edit the video, and go live all while getting paid very little. However, he loved it! It was an experience filled with riches he cannot count. He will always cherish the memories and the life-long friends he made.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=greg-mcquade-awards-and-achievements></span><span><strong>Greg McQuade Awards and Achievements</strong></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since taking his first job as a storyteller in 1997, he has earned;</p><ul><li>33 Emmy Awards,</li><li>34 regional Edward R.
