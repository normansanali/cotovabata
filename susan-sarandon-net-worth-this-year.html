It can also provide you with surprises because it’s so compressed – if you walk around, you just find things.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I look forward to being older when what you look like becomes less and less an issue and what you are is the point.”&nbsp;</p><p>“In the theater, you’re so much more in charge as an actor. For better or for worse, you know what the audience is seeing. But you can be acting your socks off on film, and then you see the movie, and the camera is on the other actor, or they’ve cut out the lines you thought were significant, or they’ve adjusted the plot. So much of it is out of your control.”</p><p>“I just want my kids to love who they are, have happy lives, and find something they want to do and make peace with that. Your job as a parent is to give your kids not only the instincts and talents to survive, but help them enjoy their lives.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6jCtK3NZqqaqpGjsbC6jKecrWWnpL%2B1tIytn6KrXa6yor6Oa25samlk</p></div><div id=links><a href=./venezia-cruz.html>&#171;&nbsp;Venezia Cruz</a>
