Folks that have landed roles on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Office</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a>, and even reality shows like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bachelor</a> all have a chance to get over good with audiences and move onto different projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Noel Fisher has been in the game for far longer than some realize, but the truth is that most people know him best for his time as Mickey on the series&nbsp;Shameless. That series certainly opened doors for the performer, and since breaking out on the show, he has been quite busy.</p><p>Let’s take a look at what Noel Fisher has been up to!</p><h2 id=he-s-been-appearing-on-the-conners>He’s Been Appearing On The Conners</h2><p>To kick things off with what Noel Fisher has been up to, we can go ahead and stay in the world of television. He has thrived on the small screen over the years, and while being on&nbsp;Shameless has been huge, he has also appeared on other successful shows like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Conners</a>.</p><p>For the unfamiliar,&nbsp;The Conners is actually a continuation of the popular 90s series&nbsp;Roseanne, which was a powerhouse in its prime.&nbsp;The Conners has actually been successful ever since making its way onto the small screen, even during times when controversy has reared its ugly head.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the cool things about seeing Noel on&nbsp;The Conners is the fact that his&nbsp;Shameless co-star, Emma Kenney, is also on the series. Emma made a name for herself by playing the character Deb Gallagher on&nbsp;Shameless, so fans of that show certainly enjoy the times when Noel is on&nbsp;The Conners.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of that series,&nbsp;IMDb, shows that Noel Fisher has appeared on other shows, as well. Back in 2019, he took part on the show&nbsp;The Red Line with Noah Wyle, and that miniseries wound up netting some decent reviews when it premiered. Fisher was also featured on the series&nbsp;Castle Rock back in 2018.</p><p>That is quite a lot of television work within the last two years, and it shows that Noel Fisher is someone that studios clearly love working with. As time moves on, people will certainly be keeping an eye out to see which other shows he winds up appearing on and even starring in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Don’t worry, as cool as television is, Noel Fisher has been up to a whole lot more than just appearing on the small screen.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Inside ‘Shameless’ Star Jeremy Allen White’s Relationship With Addison Timlin</a></span></p><h2 id=he-voiced-brainiac-for-dc>He Voiced Brainiac For DC</h2><p>With roles on&nbsp;The Conners and&nbsp;Castle Rock being notable entries on his filmography, Noel Fisher is clearly doing well for himself. However, a look at some of the movies that he has done will also show that he has been busy there, as well. For instance, Noel had the chance to voice the villain Brainiac in&nbsp;Justice League vs. The Fatal Five for DC.</p><p>DC does well for themselves on the big screen, as indicated by the success of films like&nbsp;Aquaman and&nbsp;Wonder Woman. However, DC fans also know that their animated movies are must-watch events, and any actor would love the chances to get involved in their animated universe. So, we can only imagine how excited Noel Fisher was when he got the call to play Brainiac.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DC is loaded with iconic villains who have all tried their hand at taking over, and Brainiac is a character with lots of fans. Sure, no one outright roots for the bad guy, but we all have our preferences. Anyone that can give Superman a run for their money is worth paying attention too, which is why Brainiac has stuck around for so long.</p><p>With DC and tv roles in the bag, some might feel like that’s plenty of work for one actor. Turns out, Noel Fisher likes to stay busy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How ‘Shameless’ Star Cameron Monaghan Angered Fans On Twitter</a></span></p><h2 id=he-appeared-in-capone-alongside-tom-hardy>He Appeared In Capone Alongside Tom Hardy</h2><p>In 2020, Noel Fisher got to mix things up a bit when he appeared in the film&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Capone</a> alongside Tom Hardy. This was a nice change of pace for Fisher, who had done a lot of voice work in film.</p><p>IMDb shows that Fisher has voiced the character, Michelangelo, in&nbsp;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in the past, but he did have a traditional role in the&nbsp;Twilight franchise. Nevertheless, Fisher got back in the live-action saddle in 2020 and was exceptional in the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will certainly be paying close attention to see if Fisher ends up doing more films, but it certainly seems like he does well for himself on television.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To ‘Shameless’ Actor Steve Howey?</a></span></p><p>Shameless is still airing new episodes, and once it eventually ends, we imagine that Noel Fisher will be a hot commodity for studios.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Is ‘Shameless’ Star Cameron Monaghan’s Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edKhmKadnJrAtHnSrZirZZ6ksq150aicoqVdm7a0tMSrZK6oXam8brrOsGY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./who-is-john-snowling-man-shoots-estranged-wife-killing-3-injuring-6-at-orange-county-pub.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is John Snowling?
