that may be present in a person’s body – or to inhibit further growth of the parasite.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>What are intestinal parasites and what causes them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are several different types of intestinal parasites, also known as intestinal worms or parasitic worms, however the most common are flatworms and roundworms.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Parasitic worms can live in the intestine for years without causing any pain or discomfort, however some sufferers may include symptoms such as:&nbsp;</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li class=class>Abdominal or stomach pain</li><li>Diarrhea&nbsp;</li><li class=class>Vomiting or nausea</li><li class=class>Gas or bloating&nbsp;</li><li class=class>Weight loss</li><li class=class>Dysentery&nbsp;</li><li class=class>Fatigue&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>There are a number of causes of intestinal worms – which are most common in children and elderly people, particularly those living in underdeveloped areas – including poor hygiene, a weakened immune system, unclean water, and undercooked meat.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ordinarily, doctors prescribe medicine as the most common form of treatment, however changes to diet may also be recommended, as well as the introduction of supplements.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Natural remedies, like papaya seeds, are popular, but these are not always recommended by medical professionals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>&lt;!—-><p><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Prescribed antiparasitic medicine usually includes an antibiotic, and they have to be recommended to patients by professional doctors and medical experts, who usually put patients through a series of tests in order to confirm the presence of a parasite.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However, there are several ‘natural’ parasitics, like papaya seeds, as well as garlic and honey, that are touted by some as an alternative to cleanse the body of any intestinal worms by killing off the parasite, allowing it to be passed out of the body in feces.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>There is very little professional research to suggest that these natural antiparasitics are actually effective, however that didn’t stop Ramena from testing the papaya seed option out, while documenting her experience for the world to see.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>After giving a brief explanation about why she is eating the seeds,&nbsp;Ramena then spoons one of them into her mouth, remarking that it’s ‘not bad’ before consuming more of the seeds – which quickly made her change her mind about their taste.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘OK that’s disgusting, it’s like dry erase marker and it was absolutely disgusting,’ she concludes, before adding: ‘I’ll let you guys know if I poop out any worms.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>True to her word, the influencer later followed up her initial post with a second clip, in which she updated her followers on the progress of her papaya seed experiment, revealing that she ended up consuming the seeds from one full half of the fruit.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ramena explained that the seeds did have an impact on her bowl movements, and noted that she believed she had passed a parasite in the hours after she ingested the papaya.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It is almost one in the morning,’ she explained in her follow-up video. ‘I ate half of a papaya’s worth of seeds, which I don’t think I was supposed to do, but I pooped three times in a couple of hours, and I haven’t pooped in days.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’ve pooped out one parasite so far.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The influencer admitted that she felt strange about documenting her bathroom habits with thousands of viewers around the world, joking: ‘I can’t believe this is my life. I’m literally on the internet right now with God knows how many people…’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>While the experiment appears to have had the intended results in so far as helping Ramena to pass parasites out of her system, she urged anyone else who is planning to test the process to check with their doctor before going ahead – confessing that the papaya seeds had also left her with some unpleasant side effects.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-53f447ad96ccc4c7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/17/20/43095709-9588409-asd-m-59_1621281422060.jpg height=704 width=634 alt="Giving it a go: Ramena explained in her first video that she had seen another TikTok user post a video about the cleanse, and she was inspired to try it out herself" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-53f447ad96ccc4c7 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/17/20/43095709-9588409-asd-m-59_1621281422060.jpg height=704 width=634 alt="Giving it a go: Ramena explained in her first video that she had seen another TikTok user post a video about the cleanse, and she was inspired to try it out herself" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=imageCaption>Giving it a go: Ramena explained in her first video that she had seen another TikTok user post a video about the cleanse, and she was inspired to try it out herself&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-2c5ae9dc0c90af3b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/17/17/43095677-9588409-image-m-27_1621269596760.jpg height=488 width=306 alt="Step by step: She posted several videos about her experiment, revealing that she ate half a papaya's worth of seeds, and ended up 'pooping three times in a couple of hours'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-2c5ae9dc0c90af3b src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/17/17/43095677-9588409-image-m-27_1621269596760.jpg height=488 width=306 alt="Step by step: She posted several videos about her experiment, revealing that she ate half a papaya's worth of seeds, and ended up 'pooping three times in a couple of hours'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><img decoding=async id=i-e5b22cdca0a55eb8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/17/17/43095681-9588409-image-m-29_1621269610469.jpg height=488 width=306 alt="Step by step: She posted several videos about her experiment, revealing that she ate half a papaya's worth of seeds, and ended up 'pooping three times in a couple of hours'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><img decoding=async id=i-e5b22cdca0a55eb8 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/17/17/43095681-9588409-image-m-29_1621269610469.jpg height=488 width=306 alt="Step by step: She posted several videos about her experiment, revealing that she ate half a papaya's worth of seeds, and ended up 'pooping three times in a couple of hours'" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p class=imageCaption>Step by step: She posted several videos about her experiment, revealing that she ate half a papaya’s worth of seeds, and ended up ‘pooping three times in a couple of hours’&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-eb87fbb1cd24d460 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2021/05/17/17/43095703-9588409-image-m-23_1621269567551.jpg height=733 width=634 alt="Warning: Ramena claimed that the cleanse made her pass two grey worms in her stool -

claims that they were easily identifiable because of their worm-like appearance.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I had one final poop, no seeds came out, and I did pass another parasite, so I

concluded that she won’t be eating papaya seeds again for a long time and claims she will need to ‘mentally and physically prepare herself’ better the next time she attempts the
